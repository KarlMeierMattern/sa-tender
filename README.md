# About this app

This is a Next.js app that fetches tenders from the South African government's eTenders website and displays them in an interactive, visual way.  
The data includes both active and awarded tenders in South Africa that are published on the eTenders website.  
The app presents two views: advertised and awarded.  
The advertised view allows you to interact with charts.  
In the awarded view you can interact with charts as well as a table to filter by tender category, government department, province, and date.
